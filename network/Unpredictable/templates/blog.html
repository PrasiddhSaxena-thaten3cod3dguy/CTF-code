            <p>
                A shaman is someone who can connect with the world of spirits and gods. This allows the person to do amazing things, like taking the skills and techniques of assimilating a spirit with him. They can ask for advice from the spirits, heal the sick, and gather the ghosts of the dead in this world. Moreover, by contacting the dead, they can also speak with great historical figures.

                Not everyone can communicate with spirits, so shamans have been revered since ancient times and there are still scattered all over the world. Shamans are located in China and Guinea tribes in Polynesia. In Japan, those who summon the spirits are called Itako and are located in the northeastern regions, while another shaman exists in the Amami Islands north of Okinawa.

                Shamans can also integrate their Guardian Ghosts and other spirits into their bodies to use their skills—known as Hyōi-Gattai — or integrate them with an object to create an Over Soul, but to do so one must be able to use the energy of a shaman called Furyoku.
