                "We do not learn martial arts to pick fights or to impress girls who will say "Oh beefcake, you're so strong, I want you." Heh. Muah. (does a kissing motion) Do you understand what I am saying? We must master the art of peace in addition to the art of war. We achieve victory by the art of war, victory is won through strategy, strategy is derived from the art of peace. However, if somebody evil threatens you or any other good innocent people with unethical force, it is your duty to defend!"

        <p class="fs-4">
            The Turtle School is a martial arts school founded by <span class="text-primary">Master Roshi</span> which presumably continues the teachings of Roshi's former sensei, <span class="text-primary">Master Mutaito</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-4">
            The first two known members of the school are <span class="text-primary">Grandpa Gohan</span> and <span class="text-primary">Ox-King</span>. Other known students of the Turtle School include <span class="text-primary">Goku</span>, <span class="text-primary">Krillin</span>, and <span class="text-primary">Yamcha</span>. The special moves which are taught to the students are the <span class="text-primary">Kamehameha</span> and <span class="text-primary">Jan Ken</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-4">
            Upon the completion of the student's training, Roshi would enlist them into the <span class="text-primary">World Martial Arts Tournament</span> as a test to their strength. However, he would also enlist himself under the alias as <span class="text-primary">Jackie Chun</span> in order to ensure his students do not win the championship, in order to prevent them from growing overconfident and neglect their future training.
